Group contribution and Group work for ICT 1 : Project - SIMTracker
Track’O is an android based mobile application created for Mobile Security. This application is only applicable for the android Smartphone users. This application will be targeting Smartphone’s SIM card’s Serial Number after they are lost or stolen and if the SIM card is changed, it will send message from the changed SIM card with the details.

This project is about developing an Android application for Smartphone that will help you track your phone even after you lose it and help you recover your lost phone without GPS.

Android OS is sophisticated and it gives freedom to explore. In order to track Cell phone without GPS, this application largely depends upon the TelephonyManager, which is responsible for every bit of telephone and SIM card details along with their handling.

This application helps user to find their cell phones based telephony manager which helps on Cell-Id, MNC (Mobile Network Code), MCC (Mobile Country Code) and LAC (Location Area Code). Using Cell ID technique, this application can pin point the location (based on cell tower) the replaced SIM user.
